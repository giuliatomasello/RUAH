RUAH
BODY AS A CENTER
Year 2012/2013
BA/Graduation project
Product Design
 
Body as an object and dress as a second skin.
RUAH is an interactive corset controlled by Arduino.
This geometric corset helps people to learn the importance and
the benefits of a deep diaphragmatic breath.
The circuit is composed by a sensor sewn on an elastic belt and
an actuator placed inside the corset.
The stretch sensor catches the move of diaphragmatic breath
and sends a feedback from lilypad to muscle wire, a flexinol
spring, inflating and deforming the centre of the structure.
Through this interaction between user and bustier, user becomes
conscious about his body and his breath, increasing his sensory
abilities and his physical endurance.
The slow controlled breath, which balances body and mind, is
acquired only after a long workout.
As the wearer feels it like a real second skin, RUAH transmits and
receives emotional feedback, contrasting a continuous sense of
stillness and movement, opposite feelings that surround us and
join up to ecstasy.
